# PowerMap_AU20
Repository for the Autumn 2020 HackI/O team "//ToDoTomorrow"
Our team worked on a project for a sponsor challenge provide by American Electric Power (AEP) in the HackOHI/O Hackathon at Ohio State on November 13th-15th, 2020. This project was focused on creating useful data about AEP's utility poles and cataloging a set of images and metadata in a readable and meaningful format. We created a backend API on a Java server with Springboot and a front end interface with HTML,CSS, JavaScript and Bootstrap. We also created a Python script to catalog the images and sort them into their respective pole locations by matching the location data. The dashboard can then be used to track issues with particular poles, access the associated metadata, and see the pole locations on an interactive map.

The team placed in the top 10 teams at HackOHI/O 2020!
